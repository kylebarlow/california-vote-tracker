# California Vote Count Tracker

## What's here
 - Scraper (scrape.py) to scrape the California SOS webpage for vote totals (for propositions and president). I commit the summary CSVs generated by the scraper so you don't need to.
 - Simple analysis script () to make a quick plotly graph showing Yes % over time

Currently, I'm not using the presidential race data, but am scraping it in case it's useful later to correlate with proposition vote changes.

If you want to run the scraper yourself, I just do it like this:
```bash
while true; do python3 scrape.py; sleep 30m; done
```
