# California Vote Count Tracker

## What's here
 - Scraper (scrape.py) to scrape the California SOS webpage for vote totals (for propositions and president). I commit the summary CSVs generated by the scraper.
 - Simple analysis script () to make a quick plotly graph showing Yes % over time

Currently, I'm not using the presidential race data, but am scraping it in case it's useful later to correlate with proposition vote changes.
